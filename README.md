The Art-Craft website allows registered users to post, update, and delete their craft items. Each user can manage only their own posts. Logged-in users can access "Add Craft," "Update Craft," and "My Craft" sections. CRUD functionality is implemented using Express and MongoDB. Registration is available via email, with login options through email, GitHub, and Google accounts. The "My Craft" route displays only the posts made by the logged-in user.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
